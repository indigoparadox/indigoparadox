<div class="iwz-twt"><p>(Me after seeing two guys in any context whatsoever) Well well well if it isn't the Bitmap Brothers.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>"Wow, this is awful!" I say, wading in and grabbing a fistful and taking a bite. "Absolutely horrible! Dreadful!" I take off my shirt and start swimming around.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I hope the "Steam Frame" is one of those art TVs with a gaudy gold-painted wood frame but for gaming.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I learned what ohagi are from Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and so I ended up internalizing "they have sewing needles in them" as part of the core concept.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>The Supreme Court has ruled 5-4 that Elves are monster girls and Landmine gyaru are gyaru, at least for the purposes of categorizing manga.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I interject with dumb jokes because I have nothing to add to anything. Literally the only thing I know is Python. If it weren't for list comprehensions I'd have no comprehension at all.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>The SCSI interface was developed by Sir Allen Shugart, for his computer, the BBC- so-called, because it could be connected to a television to use as a display.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>The opposite of Unity Desktop is Discord Mobile.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I think it's funny that if you ask most people what a "standard serial port" looks like, they'll probably say "DB-9."</p><p>Because the "DB-9" serial port is an IBM-proprietary innovation. And it's actually a DE-9.</p><p>But that's nerd territory and you won't be popular if you're a pedant like that, so at parties it's probably fine to call it a DB-9/serial port and let it slide when others do, too. ðŸ˜Œ</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>The serial port is like a floppy disk but for data.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>Notes are so good. You can just, like, leave a representation of relevant information on something, and, like, when it leaves your attention for a few minutes and you consequently forget everything about it, you can still come back, and, like, interpret that representation and know about it again. So good. Props to whoever came up with notes.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>"Tax return" is one of those idioms everyone gets confused with because it's coming from the wrong side (it's the paperwork you "return" to the IRS, not the refund). Like how an X client is software displaying graphics on an X server, not the other way around.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I think we need a lot less Gal Gadot and a lot more Gyaru Godot!</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>"Can your software fly?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, can you be more specific? It's not designed to run on an airplane computer, if that's what you mean..."</p><p>"What are the requirements for flying?"</p><p>"What do you mean by 'flying?'"</p><p>*CCs like 15 guys* "Are you saying that you are refusing to fly your software?"</p><p>"I... I... I'll open a ticket with the developer to see if we can get it to fly, OK? What version do you have?"</p><p>"The one from 5 years ago."</p><p>*Wakes up, sweating...*</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>This feed is brought to you by: Medicine.</p><p>Homeopathy not working? Chiropractor skip town after accidentally murdering a baby? Want to change your gender? Try Medicine! Vaccines, chemotherapy, Alka Seltzer Plus. You know, the real stuff.</p><p>Medicine. It'll probably help!â„¢</p><p>EDIT: Talk to your doctor to see if Medicine is right for you!</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>Saying Hedy Lamarr invented Bluetooth is like saying Marie Curie invented the Boiling Water Reactor.</p><p>It's absolutely true and correct.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I tried launching my VB4 OpenGL demo on Windows 11 and the VM rebooted.</p><p>...I say as I slowly shrink and transform into SpectateSwamp.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>Birdy the Mighty (Tetsuwan Birdy) paints a picture of an ideal society where all cops are hot big-sister-types. Yes, they still shoot kids with their space laser sometimes,  blowing their torso apart. But then they share their own body with that kid so they can become a trans girl/plural system, depending on how metaphorical you wanna get. In this essay, I will discuss how we can't let the perfect become the enemy of the good. &#129525; (1/78)</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>Remember the Super Mario World bonus levels that were all named things like Tubular or Radical? Has anyone done a ROM hack (or maybe checked the rerelease on the SNES mini) where there's a new level called "Fleek"?</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>IBM called it the AS/400 because every model weighs >400 lbs.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>One thing I kinda miss about the office is the free stuff. You could charge your batteries there for free and there was a closet with free pens and staplers and stuff and there was free copper in the walls! &#128524;</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORYYY</p><p>JULIE ANDREWS!</p><p>VS...</p><p>ANNNN MARGREEET!!!</p><p>BEGIN!</p><p>Julie Andrews: Bye-bye THIRTY -year-old, actin' fifteen! Boutta make the hills come alive with the sound of your screams!</p><p>Ann Margret: Oh, how do I solve a problem like poor Julie Andrews? Seems winning a rap battle, ain't something she can do!</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>The "nobody will remember you" folks are the funniest. Nobody will remember anyone after a few generations. Humanity will just be a thin layer of plastic sediment, and there won't be any free oil on the surface to jump-start subsequent industrial civilizations if another species is cursed with sentience. Couple that with an expanding universe divided by the invincible light-year, and the inevitability of heat death, and who do you expect to remember what from the bottom of a black hole? &#129315;&#129315;&#129315;</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>Welcome to my podcast, SNMP Trap House.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>How about a game like Papers, Please except instead of a communist country, you're a mid-level bureaucrat in a capitalist country who has to massage the excess death statistics caused by an increasing series of pandemics/natural disasters and the owner class's unwillingness to pay for social countermeasures so that your boss can get re-elected and you can keep your job?</p><p>I feel like there's an opportunity for a fun spreadsheet- or even COBOL-inspired interface depending on the direction...</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>If they had Teams in England they would call it Cheams.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>The term "Boomer Shooters" bothers me because I'm not sure if it's referring to how games of that genre go "boom" a lot (?) or just confusing gen-X'ers with Baby Boomers.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>Laying in bed remembering the time I called it "The Large Hadrian Collider" while talking to a cute girl back in college.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>My music library is kinda fucked up... I have the anthem of the Soviet Union 8-bit version, but the Red Army Choir version of Korobeiniki. Most people have them the other way around but I'm just so quirky!</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I imagine taking a cross-country trip through the US to be something like Eversion. New York through Ohio are like the first few levels, getting tougher in normal ways. By the time you get to Nebraska, there's no music and the background is red. And then in California or Washington there's a princess. Or something.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>Two's complement was one of those things I vaguely intuited in the back of my mind but never sat down and actually studied. Since writing an ASN.1 encoder for my latest engine and I need to encode negative numbers, I finally got around to it. Turns out it really is as simple as f( x ) = (~x) + 1.</p><p>It helps that the functional notation looks kinda like boobs from a front-side angle, so hopefully that can serve as a mnemonic device somehow.</p></div>

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>I was thinking about this egotistical guy who would appropriate large bodies of others' work as his own, but without the deep understanding necessary to integrate or maintain them. This would result in works that were unstable as cracks formed until they collapsed completely.

<div class="iwz-twt"><p>My comfort level at work is like a health bar... when the bar is full and green then I'm just like, "sure," and just do stuff I'm asked. When it's red I'm keeping a journal in 15-minute blocks and asking for written/signed confirmation on all directions.</p></div>
